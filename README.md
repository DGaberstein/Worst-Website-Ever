# Worst Website Ever

This project is designed to create the most annoying website possible. It includes various features that discourage users from staying on the site, such as:

- **Annoying Elements**: The website features blinking text, scrolling marquees, and autoplaying audio that loops continuously.
- **User Registration and Login**: Forms are provided for user registration and login, but the overall experience is intentionally frustrating.
- **Distracting Styles**: The CSS uses bright colors, non-standard fonts, and animations to overwhelm the user visually.
- **JavaScript Annoyances**: Additional JavaScript functionality includes random pop-ups, alerts, and redirects to further irritate users.
- **Distracting Media**: The project includes audio clips and images that are designed to be distracting and annoying.
